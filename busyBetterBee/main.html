	<h1>Goal and description</h1>
	<p>The idea behind this website and future app, is to provide a guiding light to others with similair questions and concerns. A light to those who wish to better themselves, and perhaps have no idea where to start. I myself am forging a path in the search of this goal.</p>

	<p>There are many quetions I need to answer and many complex problems that need to be solved. I cannot do this alone, I will be incorporating the ideas of men and women far greater than I, and studying them, their ideals and examples to craft what I hope to be, a small concise guide, with workable, selfmade daily tables that one can reference and use to track their progress on this journey. Does this sound like a glorified dairy? Perhaps, I hope it can be of more use to aid the person writing the dairy to become better, rather than write musings, fears, dreams and schemes. </p>

	<p>I welcome you, weary traveler of life. Take what you need here, no more, no less. Give what you can, no more, no less.</p>
